"""
EasyTV Random Playlist Builder.

Builds and plays a randomized "channel surfing" playlist of TV episodes
and optionally movies. Creates an experience similar to traditional TV
where content plays continuously in random order.

Extracted from default.py as part of modularization.

Logging:
    Logger: 'playback' (via get_logger)
    Key events:
        - playlist.create (INFO): Playlist generation started
        - playlist.start (INFO): Playlist playback started
        - playlist.parse_fail (WARNING): Failed to parse episode data
    See LOGGING.md for full guidelines.

    """
    Build and play a randomized playlist of TV episodes and optionally movies.
    
    Creates a "channel surfing" experience by randomly selecting episodes
    from available TV shows and movies, then playing them as a playlist.
    
    Episode Selection:
        The episode_selection setting controls which TV episodes are included:
        - 0 (unwatched): Only unwatched episodes (default, matches original behavior)
        - 1 (watched): Only watched episodes (for re-watching favorites)
        - 2 (both): Any episode regardless of watch status
        
        For unwatched mode, uses cached data from the service for efficiency.
        For watched/both modes, queries the library directly with server-side
        random sorting for optimal performance.
    
    Weighting Algorithm:
        The movieweight setting (0.0-1.0) controls the movie-to-TV-show ratio:
        - movieweight = 0.0: No movies, only TV episodes
        - movieweight = 0.5: Half as many movies as TV shows
        - movieweight = 1.0: Equal number of movies as TV shows
        
        Formula: movie_limit = max(show_count * movieweight, 1)
        This ensures at least 1 movie (if available) when movies are enabled.
    
    Candidate Selection:
        1. Filters shows based on population parameter (playlist/user selection)
        2. Retrieves movies based on movie_selection (unwatched/watched/both)
        3. Creates candidate list with prefixed IDs: 't123' for TV, 'm456' for movie
        4. Shuffles combined list for random order
        5. Optionally prioritizes items with partial progress (start_partials_tv/movies)
           - Finds all TV episodes and movies with resume points
           - Sorts by recency (lastplayed), same-show episodes in episode order
           - Moves all partials to front of candidate list
    
    Playlist Building:
        - Loops until 'length' items added or all candidates exhausted
        - For TV: adds episode based on episode_selection, tracks for multi-episode
        - For movies: adds movie, removes from candidate pool (no duplicates)
        - Skips premiere episodes (S01E01) if 'premieres' setting is false
        - For 'multiple_shows' mode: same show can appear multiple times
    
    Args:
        population: Dict with filter mode:
            - {'playlist': path} - Filter by smart playlist
            - {'usersel': [ids]} - Filter by user selection
            - {'none': ''} - No filtering
        random_order_shows: List of show IDs with random episode ordering
        config: RandomPlaylistConfig with all playlist settings (including episode_selection)
        logger: Optional logger instance
    
    Side Effects:
        - Clears existing video playlist
        - Sets 'EasyTV.playlist_running' to 'true'
        - Sets 'EasyTV.random_order_shuffle' to 'true'
        - Starts playlist playback via xbmc.Player
