EasyTV Changelog
================

v1.1.1 (2026-01-20)
-------------------
Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed clone settings showing blank labels (no text visible)
    - Clone settings.xml section ID now matches clone addon ID
    - Clone strings.po header now matches clone addon ID
    - Clone now built in temp folder before moving to addons (helps with caching)
  - Fixed clone missing v1.1.0 settings (season premieres, unwatched ratio, 
    movie playlist filter, playlist continuation, random order shows)
  - Fixed clone version now inherits parent version (was always 1.0.0)
  - Fixed clone default settings now match parent defaults
  - Clone startup logs now include addon_id for identification
  - Clone naming keyboard now pre-fills with "EasyTV - " prefix
  - Added safeguards to prevent overwriting existing addons during clone creation

Performance Improvements:
  - Partial prioritization 99% faster (14.6s → 0.2s on test library)
    - TV partial episode query: 14,200ms → 94ms (99.3% faster)
    - Movie partial query: 427ms → 109ms (74% faster)
  - Total random playlist build time reduced from ~18s to ~4s (78% faster)
  - Uses Kodi's native 'inprogress' filter instead of per-show queries
  - Test environment: OSMC Vero V with 168 shows, 5646 episodes, 846 movies

Improvements:
  - Enhanced action logging at INFO level:
    - Random playlist: logs content type, target length, show/movie counts
    - Browse mode: logs start/stop with show count
  - Clone creation now updates ALL language files (future Weblate support)
  - Added timing instrumentation for partial prioritization queries

Known Issues:
  - On Windows, clone uninstall may fail due to file locking. Workaround:
    restart Kodi after uninstalling a clone before creating a new one with
    the same name.
  - Clone settings labels require Kodi restart to appear (Kodi caches
    language strings at startup - this is a Kodi limitation).
